You can ask, for example: \u201cI\u2019m going to be in Boston. I like basketball. What do you suggest, Watson?\u201d You might get several answers: Celtics tickets, Boston College tickets, Harvard tickets. Or in the offseason, Watson may suggest you drive to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield (MA). Companies are already using Watson this way. Fluid, Inc.\u2019s Watson-based retail solutions deliver granular results to queries such as \u201cI am taking my wife and three children camping in upstate New York in October and I need a tent.\u201d Consider this: Watson has been taught to pass the medical boards. Would you trust it to diagnose you and prescribe medication? What if you claim to be in pain (e.g., back pain, migraines, depression) and Watson doesn\u2019t believe your subjective input? Here\u2019s more food for thought: What if Watson could learn to code? Why not? It\u2019s hardly heretical to suggest that as Watson works with developers, it will one day be able to generate solutions based on a natural language query. That\u2019s equally exciting and worrisome. Now if you want to poke a little fun at Watson, read this Steve Lohr piece in The New York Times (2013) about Watson in the kitchen. Just skim it -- the kicker is at the end.
